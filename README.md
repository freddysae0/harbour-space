# Challenge of Harbour Space üöÄ

This project is a responsive landing page, imitating the design of [Harbour Space](https://harbour.space). It features advanced animations using CSS + JavaScript. The project is built with:

- [Vue.js 3](https://vuejs.org)
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for state management
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) (minimal use).

You can view the project live at [Freddy's HS Challenge](https://hschallenge.netlify.app/).

## Desktop Preview üñ•Ô∏è

Upon startup, the site prompts the user to select an API for a specific scholarship. Due to time constraints, the API is only consumed and displayed in the first section, [HeroSection.vue](./src/sections/HeroSection.vue). However, data handling for displaying it throughout the project is implemented using [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/).

The API selection is located in the `/src/api.js` file:

```js
export const apiListUrl =
  "https://pre-prod.harbour.space/api/v1/scholarship_pages/";
```

This route indicates the different APIs available to the user, as shown in the following image:
